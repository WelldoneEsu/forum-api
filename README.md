# Start your server
npm run dev
node server.js



🛠️ Technologies Used
- Node.js  -	JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- Express.js - Web framework for handling routes and middleware.
- MongoDB	NoSQL - database for storing threads, comments, votes.
- Mongoose -  ODM for MongoDB – schema modeling and DB access.
- JWT	- JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
- Bcrypt - Password hashing (if auth system included).
- express-graphql	- Middleware for setting up a GraphQL endpoint.
- GraphQL	- Query language for APIs (bonus feature).
- Dotenv - Environment variable management.
- Nodemon	- Development tool for auto-restarting the server.
- Postman – for testing API endpoints.
- ESLint + Prettier – for code quality and formatting.



⚙️ Environment Variables
## Create a .env file in the root directory with:

- PORT=4000
- MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/forum-api
- JWT_SECRET=your-secret


✅ Deliverables
✅ Voting system (threads & comments)
